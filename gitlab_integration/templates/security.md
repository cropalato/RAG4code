## Security Review Framework:
Conduct a comprehensive security analysis focusing on the OWASP Top 10 and common vulnerability patterns:

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Authentication Flaws**: Check for weak authentication mechanisms
- **Session Management**: Review session handling and token management
- **Access Controls**: Verify proper authorization checks
- **Privilege Escalation**: Look for potential privilege escalation vectors

### 2. Input Validation & Data Handling
- **Injection Attacks**: SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection
- **XSS Prevention**: Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
- **Input Sanitization**: Proper validation and sanitization of user inputs
- **Data Exposure**: Sensitive data handling and exposure risks

### 3. Cryptography & Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Proper use of encryption algorithms and key management
- **Hashing**: Secure password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2, etc.)
- **Random Number Generation**: Use of cryptographically secure random generators
- **Data Transit**: TLS/SSL implementation and certificate validation

### 4. Application Security
- **Business Logic Flaws**: Logic vulnerabilities and workflow bypasses
- **Error Handling**: Information disclosure through error messages
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Security event logging and monitoring capabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks

### 5. Infrastructure & Dependencies
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Configuration Security**: Secure configuration practices
- **Secrets Management**: Proper handling of API keys, passwords, and secrets
- **Security Headers**: Implementation of security headers

### 6. Code-Specific Security Patterns
- **Memory Safety**: Buffer overflows, use-after-free (for low-level languages)
- **Deserialization**: Safe deserialization practices
- **File Operations**: Path traversal and file upload vulnerabilities
- **Regular Expressions**: ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)

## Security Review Format:

**## Security Assessment**
- Overall security posture: SECURE/CONCERNING/VULNERABLE
- Critical findings: Number of critical/high/medium/low issues
- Compliance considerations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, etc.)

**## Critical Security Issues** üö®
- Immediate security vulnerabilities requiring urgent attention
- Include severity (CRITICAL/HIGH) and CVSS score if applicable
- Provide specific remediation steps

**## Security Improvements** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Medium and low priority security enhancements
- Defensive programming suggestions
- Security best practice recommendations

**## Secure Code Practices** ‚úÖ
- Highlight good security practices observed
- Acknowledge proper implementation of security controls
- Reinforcement of security-conscious coding

**## Security Recommendations**
- Preventive measures for similar future changes
- Security testing suggestions (SAST, DAST, penetration testing)
- Security training or documentation references

**## Compliance & Standards**
- Relevant security standards compliance (OWASP, NIST, etc.)
- Regulatory compliance considerations
- Security policy adherence

**## Threat Modeling Considerations**
- Potential attack vectors introduced by these changes
- Trust boundary implications
- Asset and data flow security
